E-commerce with supabase is a website with supabase in backend and vuejs in frontend, The reason why i made this because i think this is great website and also great to push my skill.

I created this website within a week.

I think i not found any problem to build this website, except when user type directyly in browser the page is showing 404, and i fix that problem.
